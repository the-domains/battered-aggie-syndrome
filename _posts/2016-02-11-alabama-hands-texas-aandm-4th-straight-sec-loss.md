description: "The past two weeks of Texas A&M basketball, losers of four consecutive SEC games, can be summed up by a pair of free-throw attempts, or more accurately, a pair of missed free throws. Aggies senior guard Anthony Collins, the SEC's most accurate free-throw shooter at 93.8%, had missed just two of his first 32 free throw attempts this season."
