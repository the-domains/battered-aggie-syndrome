description: "COLLEGE STATION, Texas -- When Kentucky's Isaac Humphries got a technical late in overtime on Saturday for slamming the ball to the court, there was a lot of confusion as to exactly what happened and why. The Texas A&M Aggies weren't worried about any of that and were overcome instead by a sense of relief -- and gratitude."
